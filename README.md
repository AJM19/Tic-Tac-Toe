# Tic-Tac-Toe
Created in 2019

This version of Tic Tac Toe is a text-based java written game that is played
by entering coordiantes of where you would like to place either your "X" or "O".

Enjoy!

**** I have since created more efficient algorithms for checking rows, columns, and diagonals. This was one of my first solo projects I created***
